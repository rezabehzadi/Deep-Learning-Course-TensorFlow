# 04. Sequences-Time-Series-and-Prediction 
This document provides a brief overview of time series analysis and forecasting. 
It covers key concepts like trend, seasonality, noise, autocorrelation, and non-stationary time series. 
It also explores different forecasting methods, including statistical and machine learning approaches. 
The document delves into the process of creating and predicting synthetic data, preparing time series features and labels, and 
training various neural network architectures for forecasting. Additionally, it discusses the application of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and 
long short-term memory (LSTM) cells for modeling sequential dependencies in time series data. 
Finally, it demonstrates the use of these techniques for predicting sunspot activity.
